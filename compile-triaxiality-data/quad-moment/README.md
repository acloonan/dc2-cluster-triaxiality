# quad-moment
I'm currently testing an algorithm to calculate quadrupole moments for cosmoDC2 redMaPPer cluster using cluster members. These tests can be found here.

The Jupyter notebook is supposed to call upon functions and classes in shape_model_acloonan.py, but it doesn't really work yet. Will add \_\_init\_\_.py and all that stuff once I figure out how to get it to work in NERSC.

A couple of notes for me to go back to in the class `HaloShape` are marked using `###`.
