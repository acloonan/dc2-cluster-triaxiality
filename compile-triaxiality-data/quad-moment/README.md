# quad-moment
I'm currently testing an algorithm to calculate quadrupole moments for cosmoDC2 redMaPPer cluster using cluster members. These tests can be found here.

The Jupyter notebook calls upon functions and classes in shape_model_acloonan.py. Will add \_\_init\_\_.py and all that stuff once I figure out how to get it to work.
