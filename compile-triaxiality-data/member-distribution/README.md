# member-distribution

Right now, I'm using this folder to store notebooks that test GCR and H5py methods of compiling cluster members' comoving Cartesian coordinates.

After a method has been selected with some confidence, I'll utilize member Cartesian data to calculate each cluster's quadrupole moment,
profiling the each cluster's member distribution. The notebook(s) with this method will be added to this folder as well.

**These are probably the most relevant programs I've added to the entire repository yet. So far, the H5py method has appeared to work properly.**

Also, currently, the H5py notebook is over 1 MB, which seems to mean that collaborators cannot edit the document from within GitHub.
