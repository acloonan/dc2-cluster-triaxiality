# compile-triaxiality-data
Compile quantities that will be necessary for calculating orientation and ellipticity of galaxy clusters in [cosmoDC2](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/cosmodc2).

## Notebooks
Run through `halo_redMcluster_matching.ipynb` first, as the FITS files produced in that notebook will be important in other notebooks.
