# compile-triaxiality-data
Compile quantities that will be necessary for calculating orientation and ellipticity of galaxy clusters in [cosmoDC2](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/cosmodc2).

## Notebooks
For now, run through `halo_redMcluster_matching.ipynb` first, as the FITS files produced in that notebook will be important in other notebooks. This might become irrelevant later, as the matching algorithms might not be necessary.
